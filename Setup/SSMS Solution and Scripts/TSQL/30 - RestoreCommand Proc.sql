/*************************************************************************************************************
Script for creating automated restore scripts based on Ola Hallengren's Maintenance Solution. 
Source: https://ola.hallengren.com

Create RestoreCommand s proc in location of Maintenance Solution procedures 
and CommandLog table along with creating job steps.

At least one full backup for all databases should be logged to CommandLog table (i.e., executed through Maintenance Solution
created FULL backup job) for generated restore scripts to be valid. 
Restore scripts are generated based on CommandLog table, not msdb backup history.

Restore script is created using ouput file. Each backup job overwrites restore script file in separate step so that only
the most recent version is maintained for immediate DR. If possible, perform a tail log backup and add to end of restore script 
in order to avoid data loss (also remove any replace options for full backups).

Make sure sql agent has read / write to the directory that you want the restore script created.

Script will read backup file location from @Directory value used in respective DatabaseBackup job (NULL is supported). 
Set @LogToTable = 'Y' for all backup jobs! (This is the defaut).
